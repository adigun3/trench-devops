The emerging security threat analysis has shown that in 2019, digital transformation were haunted by new attacks resulting in huge data loss and complete breakdown of infrastructures. 
With the growth of distributed computing at a rapid rate, securing these infrastructure becomes a huge concern and Trench provides the solution.
Monitoring this huge distributed computing represents a very important aspect of an organization or an enterprise to determine the latency impact of this tool on incoming request and the performance of the system as a whole. 
Monitoring provides feasibility into the performance, security, health status and configuration of the infrastructure, providing a range of metrics and alerts into the whole system. Selecting the right monitoring tool is likewise as important as customizing the tool to provide valuable and specific metrics of the system.   
In addition, the cost effectiveness and saving resulting from the real time monitoring and quick intervention, is a huge plus to an organization.


# Provenance
This project involves deploying Trench as a containerized application and monitored to determine the latency and network traffic impact Trench has on incoming request. I deployed the application with a docker image as a fully containerized application in a simulated production environment. This Trench tool provides and detect malicious requests early, however this process impacts latency and subsequently user experience. In the light of this, I also monitored the application for performance using Prometheus and Grafana to provide feasibility, auto-scalling and quick intervention into the distributed computing when the bottleneck in traffic arise.
